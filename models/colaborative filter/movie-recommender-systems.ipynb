They are as follows:\n","\n","1. **Simple Recommender:** This system used overall TMDB Vote Count and Vote Averages to build Top Movies Charts, in general and for a specific genre. The IMDB Weighted Rating System was used to calculate ratings on which the sorting was finally performed.\n","2. **Content Based Recommender:** We built two content based engines; one that took movie overview and taglines as input and the other which took metadata such as cast, crew, genre and keywords to come up with predictions. We also deviced a simple filter to give greater preference to movies with more votes and higher ratings.\n","3. **Collaborative Filtering:** We used the powerful Surprise Library to build a collaborative filter based on single value decomposition. The RMSE obtained was less than 1 and the engine gave estimated ratings for a given user and movie.\n","4. **Hybrid Engine:** We brought together ideas from content and collaborative filterting to build an engine that gave movie suggestions to a particular user based on the estimated ratings that it had internally calculated for that user.\n","\n","Previous -> [The Story of Film](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-story-of-film/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"304b0809-4070-4954-99ed-203a4b8b6956","_uuid":"e53889f19f6d352bb0418567941dff8f9e57da41","collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":3405,"sourceId":6663,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":false,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.9"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
