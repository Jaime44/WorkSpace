Those with such recommendation systems analyze the user's past preferences and likes, and suggest new items based on similar content.\n","\n","Content-based recommendation analyzes the content of items and determines the ones that are suitable for the user based on similarity criteria. For example, when making a movie recommendation, the system can take into account the genres, actors, directors, and other features of the movies the user has liked or watched. Based on this information, the system suggests other movies with similar characteristics.\n","\n","This recommendation system can utilize text analysis, tagging, categorization, or other content features along with the user profile or history to better understand the user's preferences. For instance, when making a music recommendation, the system can analyze features such as genres, instruments, tempo, and rhythm.\n","\n","Content-based recommendation systems can be effective in providing personalized recommendations based on user preferences. The recommended items based on the user's past data can capture their interest and provide a better user experience."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Business Problem\n","To recommend movies similar to the movies that a person who comes to our site to watch movies."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Road Map\n","\n","- 1.
